# Home-Automation
This is a simple website for Home Automation. We can control electronic/electric appliances from anywhere in the world through internet. Firebase database is used to connect the hardware (ESP-8266 or other) and website. We can control these things with switches or voice instructions.

There are 4 sample switches in this website.
# Voice Instructions
 1. "Alexa, first (or second or third or fourth) switch on"
 2. "Alexa, switch 1 (or 2 or 3 or 4) on"
 
 Note:- We can also use other words with these instructions. Mic will not work when we host this web page in http protocol.
